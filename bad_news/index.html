#### *Helping your Community Through a Rough Patch*

    Rich Bowen

## Story time ...

### I'll bet that's not the story you were expecting ...
---
### Ok, here's another story
---
## A date which will live ...

## Disclaimer

I'm not here to talk about that announcement, defend it, explain it, or
otherwise answer your questions about it.

Instead, I'll be talking about what you do after you make your community
angry.
---
## 1. Remember what hat you're wearing
![](img/centoshat.jpg) ![](img/redhathat.png)

The answer to this question should guide everything you say in public for or about your project.

Note:
* Are you the community representative? Are you just a company spokesperson?
* I have to decide, daily, to be the voice of the community - even when I disagree with them, and even when it's going to piss off my coworkers.
---
## 2. Remember whose side you're on
* Ideally, you are not confused about whose side you’re on
* … also, if you see it as us vs them, then take a step back and a deep breath ...

Note:
Also, if anyone inside your organization starts to frame conversations
as us vs them, you've got to address that first. If the community is
seen as the enemy, you have a much bigger problem.
---
## The Stages of Grief

<img src="img/grief.jpg">

Note:
Watching the conversation around CentOS Stream was fascinating, because
it absolutely went through these phases. However, in any large
distributed community, someone is always finding out about a thing for
the first time today.
---
## Compassion
* Don’t get defensive
* Be patient, and listen a lot.
* Accept that they might not forgive you. Do your job anyway.
---
## Don't get defensive
* As soon as you get defensive, it’s a good sign that you have forgotten which hat you’re wearing
* Remember what hat you’re wearing, and whose side you're on
---
## It's not personal
It's kind of personal, though.

Note:
* Unless you are completely without compassion, it's going to feel personal.
* That said, if you try to make it about yourself, that will absolutely backfire.
---
## Talking to the Press
* Don’t
* No, really, don’t
* Ask your PR person before talking to the press
* Remember what hat you’re wearing
* Assume that everything you say will be twisted into a narrative that makes for a titillating headline. Try to imagine how it’s going to get twisted.

Note:
Most of the reporters we deal with are ethical and committed to truth.
But it's hard to resist a good splashy headline, and it's hard to resist
feeding a fire. Assume that every word you say will be a headline.
---
## Social Media
* See also ... talking to the Press
* You believe that your personal and “role” twitter accounts are separate. You are mistaken
* Your off-hand “joke” tweet is, in fact, an official position statement from your project, and will sound harsh, callous, dismissive
---
### There is honor in the tweet not sent

![](img/socrates.jpg)

Note:
* As Socrates famously said:
* You do not have to respond to every tweet. Especially when your best response is a cutting comeback.
* Again: Remember whose side you are on
---
Pro tip: You are always wearing all your hats.

![](img/500hats.jpg)

Note:
Dirty little secret about the "which hat?" question - The question is a lie. You don't get to change hats. Sorry.

Note:
The wise Theo Schlossnagle also observes ...
---
## Always tell the truth

![](img/truth.jpg)

Note:
* Note that this contradicts my above advice about the Press. Sometimes. Kinda. Except that it doesn’t

---
## Truth
* Your users/customers/audience are smarter than you are
* As a community manager, trust is your most important asset

Note:
* If you bend the truth, even a little, they will call you on it, and explain in gruesome detail why you’re wrong, and assume that you lied intentionally
---
## Truth
* If you don’t know something:
    * Say so
    * Go find out

Note: You don't get to hide behind "I don't know" indefinitely, but if
it's the truth, then say so.
---
## Insider info
* If something is secret, say “I can’t talk about that.”
* Don’t throw your employer under the bus.

![](img/bus.jpg)
Note:
* Sometimes it’s better not to say anything. Be discerning.
* To throw someone under the bus is to criticize, blame, or punish them, especially in order to avoid blame or gain an advantage.

---
## Trust

When you have broken trust (real, or perceived - doesn't matter)
rebuilding that trust is your whole job.
---
## Don't make (or imply) empty promises
* Be completely transparent about whether you can do anything about their complaints.
* Do not promise changes, or even suggest that they are possible, if they are not.

Note:
In the case of CentOS Linux, CentOS Stream, we’re not changing our mind. Pretending that we might is a HUGE disservice to the community.
---
## Listen
* Listen more than you talk
* You need to understand where your community is coming from
* It will help you advocate better
* It helps your company know what problems they’re solving
* As a community manager, trust is your most important asset
---
## Don't get fired
* Remember what hats you wear ...
* … and don’t burn any of them
* Wait before sending that email/tweet/whatever. Every time.
* Being a community manager is always a balancing act between priorities and perspectives.
