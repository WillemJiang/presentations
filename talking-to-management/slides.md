???

There are many motivations for writing open source software. Your
company's motivations are entirely different.
---

# Why do you do open source?

???

* Ask the question
* Fun
* Scratching your own itch
* Socialization
* "Giving back"
* Make the world a better place, and possibly be remembered for it
* Resume building, education

???

The great thing about FOSSAsia, and events like it, is that we can sit
around the campfire and speak a common language.

---

# That is not why your company does open source

* Profit
* Customers
* Shareholders
* Profit
* Employees (If you're lucky)
* Profit

???

Probably in that order

---

# Disclaimer

???

I am sure you have a wonderful manager, and that they understand open
source. Otherwise you wouldn't be at this event. But somewhere up the
management chain is someone with different priorities.

---

*Translation*

???

When you are talking to management about open source, you must speak
their language.

---

# How does this benefit ...

* The customer
* The product/service
* The company
    * Cost/Profit
    * Recruiting
    * Reputation

---

???

Don't talk philosophy

* Licenses
* Jargon
* "Free" vs "Open"

---

*Time image goes here*

???

You have a limited amout of time to make your point. Spending that time
on the nuances of Free/Libre/Open/Puppies will work against you, and
persuade your manager that you are don't care about the same things she
does.

---

# "Giving back"

* Your company is not a charity

???

Management often sees open source as a renewable resource that they can
take and take and take, with no end in sight.

---

# Instead talk about the supply chain

* Sustainability
* Supply chain security

???

* When you use a natural resource, you need to ensure that it's still
around next year.

* Your manager loved talking about the supply chain. They read an
  article about SBOMs last month, and have been looking for an
  opportunity to bring it up in conversation.

* If your company is betting millions (billions?) of dollars on
  something that relies on an open source project, shouldn't they be
  concerned that the project is healthy and sustainable?

---

# Sustainable open source

* Multiple vendors
* Multiple maintainers
* Responsive to user (customer) needs

---

# Earning trust/merit

* Your company is not in it to be *popular*, but to be *successful*
* They certainly don't care if *you* are popular

---

# Instead talk about Influence

* Steering/leading the project in our direction

???

* This can be dangerous, though, if your company doesn't understand open social norms
* Don't claim you own/lead/invented an open source project.

---

# And talk about Adoption

* Open sourcing to drive adoption of our solution
* Influence in the larger tech space

???

eg Kubernetes

---

# Fun

* Your company is not interested in you having fun

---

# Instead talk about recruitement

* Talking about your open source work makes your employer an attractive
  place to work

---

# Resume building

* Your employer is **very** not interested in you building your resume

---

# Instead talk about continuing education

* Expertise in software your company relies on
* Even better, it's free

---

# Free!

* Your company does not want to give their product away for free

???

Free as in puppies!

---

# Instead talk about customer value

* If you're hosting a service, customers can build and test at home, deploy on your service, what you sell is expertise, not software
* If you sell software, open source is a way for the customer to
  directly influence the feature set, and helps them trust your solution

---

# Can't we just ... ?

???

*
