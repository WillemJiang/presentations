## Title Why Open Source Matters

## Idea: 

For a newbie audience, explain very simply what open source is, and why
they should care. Geared primarily to a non-technical, customer-facing
audience who needs to know enough to know what to say to customers, and
how to understand what customers are saying.

## Abstract

Open source is in everything, and is a huge part of your business,
whether or not you are aware of it. Understanding what open source is
and how your company interacts with it is critical to earning and
keeping customer trust. Just as importantly, being ignorant of open
source exposes your company to numerous risks. In this talk, we'll learn
what open source is, why you should care, and what are these hidden
risks.
