### I'll bet that's not the story you were expecting ...

### Ok, here's another story

## A date which will live ...

## Disclaimer

![](img/monkeys.jpg)

Note:
Reminder: Not here to defend or explain that decision
Instead, I'll be talking about what you do after you make your community
angry. ðŸ˜¡

'Cause you're gonna make your community angry, if, perhaps, not as
spectacularly as I have.

## 1. Remember what hat you're wearing
![](img/centoshat.jpg) ![](img/redhathat.png)

The answer to this question should guide everything you say in public for or about your project.

Note:
* Are you the community representative? Are you just a company spokesperson?
* I have to decide, daily, to be the voice of the community - even when I disagree with them, and even when it's going to piss off my coworkers.
---
## 2. Remember whose side you're on
* Ideally, you are not confused about whose side you're on
* ... also, if you see it as us vs them, then take a step back and a deep breath ...

Note:
* if anyone inside your organization starts to frame conversations
as us vs them, you've got to address that first.
* If the community is
seen as the enemy, you have a much bigger problem.

## The Stages of Grief

<img src="img/grief.jpg">

Note:
Watching the conversation around CentOS Stream was fascinating, because
it absolutely went through these phases. However, in any large
distributed community, someone is always finding out about a thing for
the first time today.
---
## Compassion
* Don't get defensive
* Be patient, and listen a lot.
* Accept that they might not forgive you. Do your job anyway.
---
## Don't get defensive
* As soon as you get defensive, it's a good sign that you have forgotten which hat you're wearing
* Remember what hat you're wearing, and whose side you're on
---
## Listen
Listen more than you talk

Note:
* You need to understand where your community is coming from
* It will help you advocate better
* It helps your company know what problems they're solving
* As a community manager, trust is your most important asset
---
## Acknowledge Grievances

We have a tendency to assume that "they" are wrong, and we just need to
explain better.
---
## It's not personal
It's kind of personal, though.

Note:
* Unless you are completely without compassion, it's going to feel personal.
* That said, if you try to make it about yourself, that will absolutely backfire.
---
## Talking to the Press
* Don't

Note:
* No, really, don't
* Ask your PR person before talking to the press
* Remember what hat you're wearing
* Assume that everything you say will be twisted into a narrative that makes for a titillating headline. Try to imagine how it's going to get twisted.

Most of the reporters we deal with are ethical and committed to truth.
But it's hard to resist a good splashy headline, and it's hard to resist
feeding a fire. Assume that every word you say will be a headline.
---
## Social Media
* See above (talking to the Press)

Note:
* You believe that your personal and "role" twitter accounts are separate. You are mistaken
* Your off-hand "joke" tweet is, in fact, an official position statement from your project, and will sound harsh, callous, dismissive, tone-deaf to someone.
---
### There is honor in the tweet not sent

![](img/socrates.jpg)

Note:
* As Socrates famously said:
* You do not have to respond to every tweet. Especially when your best response is a cutting comeback.
* Again: Remember whose side you are on
---
Pro tip: You are always wearing all your hats.

![](img/500hats.jpg)

Note:
Dirty little secret about the "which hat?" question - The question is a lie. You don't get to change hats. Sorry.

Note:
The wise Theo Schlossnagle also observes ...
---
## Always tell the truth

![](img/truth.jpg)

Note:
* Note that this contradicts my above advice about the Press. Sometimes. Kinda. Except that it doesn't

---
## Truth
* Your users/customers/audience are smarter than you are
* As a community manager, trust is your most important asset

Note:
* If you bend the truth, even a little, they will call you on it, and explain in gruesome detail why you're wrong, and assume that you lied intentionally
---
## Truth
* If you don't know something:
    * Say so
    * Go find out

Note: You don't get to hide behind "I don't know" indefinitely, but if
it's the truth, then say so.
---
## Insider info
* If something is secret, say "I can't talk about that."
* Don't throw your employer (or, in my case, your former employer!) under the bus.

![](img/bus.jpg)
Note:
* Sometimes it's better not to say anything. Be discerning.
* To throw someone under the bus is to criticize, blame, or punish them, especially in order to avoid blame or gain an advantage.

---
## Trust

When you have broken trust (real, or perceived - doesn't matter)
rebuilding that trust is your whole job.
---
## Don't make (or imply) empty promises
* Be completely transparent about whether you can do anything about their complaints.
* Do not promise changes, or even suggest that they are possible, if they are not.

Note:
In the case of CentOS Linux, CentOS Stream, Red Hat is not changing their mind. Pretending that they might is a HUGE disservice to the community.
---
## Don't get fired
* Remember what hats you wear ...
* ... and don't burn any of them
* Wait before sending that email/tweet/whatever. Every time.
* Being a community manager is always a balancing act between priorities and perspectives.
