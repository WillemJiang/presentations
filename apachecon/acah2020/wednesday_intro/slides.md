Come learn why thousands of companies use Apache Druid and Imply (powered by Apache Druid) for hot analytics alongside their data warehouses.
Learn from the experts at Imply, the creators of Apache Druid, as they show you how to:

 *   Graphically load streaming data from Kafka and Spark, and create dimensions and metrics
 *   Combine streaming and historical data from your data lake or data warehouse
 *   Get alerts, build and explore real-time dashboards, and see AI-powered explanations

## Building a real-time data processing pipeline using Apache Kafka, Kafka Connect, Elasticsearch and Kibana

???

With the rapid onset of the global Covid-19 Pandemic from the start of this year the USA Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had to quickly implement a new Covid-19 specific pipeline to collect testing data from all of the USA’s states and territories, and carry out other critical steps including integration, cleaning, checking, enrichment, analysis, and enforcing data governance and privacy etc. The pipeline then produces multiple consumable results for federal and public agencies. They did this in under 30 days, using Apache Kafka.
In this presentation we'll build a similar (but simpler) pipeline for ingesting, integrating, indexing, searching/analysing and visualising some publicly available data in around 30 minutes. We'll briefly introduce each technology and component, and walk through the steps of using Apache Kafka, Kafka Connect, Elasticsearch and Kibana to build the pipeline and visualise the results.
