???

* Introduce yourself. AWS, Apache, 20+ years in FLOSS
* There are many motivations for writing open source software. Your company's motivations are entirely different.

---

# What I'm going to tell you, and why you should care

* How to talk to management about open source

### Because

* You like getting paid to work on open source
* So you want your company to have a positive experience with it
* And it's up to you to persuade management to do this correctly

### Also 

* You should want your company to **succeed**

---

# So ... why are you here?

???

* What do you want to learn?
* Are you in a specific scenario you want help with?

---

# Why do you do open source?

![question](images/question.png)

???

* Ask the question
    * Fun
    * Scratching your own itch
    * Socialization
    * "Giving back"
    * Make the world a better place, and possibly be remembered for it
    * Resume building, education
    * Oh, and because it's your job

???

* The great thing about FOSSAsia, and events like it, is that we can sit
around the campfire and speak a common language.
* We all have stories about corporate types who Just Don't Get It, and
  we can laugh at them together.

---

# That is not why your company does open source

* Profit
* Customers
* Shareholders
* Profit
* Employees (If you're lucky)
* Profit

???

Probably in that order

---

# Disclaimer: 

## Obviously not **YOUR** manager!

???

* I am sure you have a wonderful manager, and that they understand open
  source. Otherwise you wouldn't be at this event. But somewhere up the
  management chain is someone with different priorities.

???

When you are talking to management about open source, you must speak
their language.

---

# What's in it for the company?

![dollar](images/dollar.png)

???
* The customer
* The product/service
* The company
    * Cost/Profit
    * Recruiting
    * Reputation

---

# Philosophy

![philosophy](images/Plato-Socrates-Aristotle.png)

???

Don't talk philosophy, unless they ask. Certainly not in a first
conversation.

* Licenses
* Jargon
* "Free" vs "Open"

---

# Got a minute?

![stopwatch](images/stopwatch.jpg)

???

* You have a limited amout of time to make your point - or, at least, 
  to persuade your audience that you are worth listening to. Spending that time
  on the nuances of Free/Libre/Open/Puppies will work against you, and
  persuade your manager that you are don't care about the same things she
  does.
* Miguel De Icaza presentation, OSCon, long long ago.

---

# "Giving back"

* Giving back is a moral obligation
* You are building your company on the back of "free" labor

### But ...

* Your company is not a charity

???

* Management often sees open source as a renewable resource that they can
  take and take and take, with no end in sight.
* Your attitude that open source contribution is a moral obligation, or
  "for the greater good" or any such thing, comes across as nonsense
  unless there is an actual business benefit.

---

# Instead talk about the supply chain

![chain](images/chain.jpg)

???

* Sustainability
* Supply chain security

* When you use a natural resource, you need to ensure that it's still
around next year.

* Your manager loved talking about the supply chain. They read an
  article about SBOMs last month, and have been looking for an
  opportunity to bring it up in conversation.

* If your company is betting millions (billions?) of dollars on
  something that relies on an open source project, shouldn't they be
  concerned that the project is healthy and sustainable?

* Demonstrate, with numbers, how this project is a critical part of your
  supply chain. Data is your friend here.

* Talk about supply chain horror stories. There are so many from which
  to choose.

* This is **long term** thinking, not about solving immediate problems.
  That looks good to managers.

---

# What is sustainable open source?

* Multiple vendors
* Multiple maintainers
* Responsive to user (customer) needs
* Stake holders participate!

---

# Earning trust/merit

* Your company is not in it to be *popular*, but to be *successful*
* They certainly don't care if *you* are popular

---

# Instead talk about Influence

* Steering/leading the project in our direction

???

* This can be dangerous, though, if your company doesn't understand open social norms
* Don't claim you own/lead/invented an open source project.

---

# And talk about Adoption

* Open sourcing to drive adoption of our solution
* Influence in the larger tech space

???

eg Kubernetes

---

# Fun

* Your company is not interested in you having fun

---

# Instead talk about recruitement

* Talking about your open source work makes your employer an attractive
  place to work

---

# Resume building

* Your employer is **very** not interested in you building your resume

---

# Instead talk about continuing education

* Expertise in software your company relies on
* Even better, it's free

---

# But, isn't open source free?

![puppy](images/puppy.jpg)

???

Free as in puppies!

---

# Instead talk about customer value

???

* Software is easy, people are hard. What you sell is expertise, not software
* Participation in open source establishes that expertise
* Open source is also a way to comodotize your competitor's product, and
  make the conversation about expertise, not software
* If you sell software, open source is a way for the customer to
  directly influence the feature set, and helps them trust your solution

---

# Can't we just ... ?

???

*
