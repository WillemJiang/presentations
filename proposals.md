### Notes

* Even if you're the leader, it hurts you, because people will be
  reluctant to contribute because 1) you're already paying a team to do
  the work 2) why should I do your work for you for free so that you
  can charge me to use it and 3) not sure I trust you not to change the
  license some day.
* Project is always at risk of the dominant company changing their
  direction, or changing their mind entirely, leaving you holding the
  bag.

## Title: Why Open Source Matters

## Idea: 

For a newbie audience, explain very simply what open source is, and why
they should care. Geared primarily to a non-technical, customer-facing

Open source is in everything, and is a huge part of your business,
whether or not you are aware of it. Understanding what open source is
and how your company interacts with it is critical to earning and
keeping customer trust. Just as importantly, being ignorant of open
source exposes your company to numerous risks. In this talk, we'll learn
what open source is, why you should care, and what are these hidden
risks.

## Title: Talking with management about open source

## Abstract

For those of us who already know how important open source is, it can be challenging to persuasively make the case to management, because we assume that everyone already knows the basics. This can work against us, confusing our audience and making us come across as condescending or concerned about irrelevant lofty philosophical points.

In this talk, we take it back to the basics. What does management actually need to know about open source, why it matters, and how to make decisions about consuming open source, contributing to open source, and open sourcing company code?

## Audience: Open source experts
