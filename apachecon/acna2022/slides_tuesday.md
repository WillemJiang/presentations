## Apache Infrastructure Team

???

The Apache Infrastructure team are the people that provide technical support for all projects at Apache. If you want to discuss anything with them, they’re sitting at a table at the bottom of the escalators, on the opposite side of the elevators from the registration desk, most of the day. Drop by any time.

## Get more involved in the ASF

During yesterday’s keynotes, we learned a lot of you are here for the first time, and some of you have asked how you can get more involved.

???

We’re very excited to have you! The Apache newcomers guide is a great place to start, but you can hear about one specific way to help out today at 12:10 in Bob Paulin’s talk on fundraising at the ASF in Muses.
